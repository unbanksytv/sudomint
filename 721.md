SPDX and Pragma
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

The SPDX License Identifier tells the compiler, developer, and anyone reading the smart contract what they're allowed to do with it legally. There are many different licenses in software development. The MIT and Apache licences are among the most popular, and most developers are semi-familiar with their restrictions. 

This website contains an extensive list of SPDX compatible licenses if you encounter one and are unsure what the restrictions are.

The license here is The Unlicense

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
This line tells the Solidity which version of the code compiler to use. In this case, ^0.8.0, which means "any version up to 0.9.0." 


Library Imports
A lot of programming requires writing repetitive code. If you find yourself reusing the same functions frequently you can put them into a library for reuse. You can use those libraries in your code by importing them.

You'll see the words OpenZepplin a lot. The reason is that OpenZepplin has many code libraries with permissive licenses. As a result, code libraries save time and reduce the chance of security errors.



import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";
This line imports String utilities from another contract, Strings.sol. 

Stings.sol is a library for working with text.



import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
ERC721 is the specification for a Non-Fungible Token. This code imports a pre-constructed version of that specification. Our code will inherit from this code to include all of its functionality. Our code can extend and replace the inherited code with new code. 

Think of it like a template or "parent" that provides us with all the necessary structures for ERC721 compatibility.



import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
*Ownable* adds code that can help check if the user performing specific actions is the owner. 

Imagine for a moment that the contract is a cash register; only the owner should be allowed to withdraw the funds from it. 



import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
To keep track of objects, we'll be using counters. These counters allow us to create an ID for each NFT that we can look up later.



import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
This code allows us to protect functions against "re-entrance attacks." 

We have two contracts, A and B. When Contract A calls contract B. and a reentrancy exploit allows B to call back into A before A finishes execution. 

This code will allow us to protect our code from that exploit.



import "./IContent.sol";
IContent.sol is the interface to our content renderer. I haven't included it in the contract, but it renders all the view data in tokenURI on the NFT (we'll get to this in a bit.)

This library also adds another interface IItemRenderer, which we will use to render the NFT contents.



import "hardhat/console.sol";
When you're developing, occasionally, you want to see what is happening inside your contract. This code imports a function called console.log which I can use two write a message out onto the Ethereum terminal screen. It's helpful in finding problems.



The Contract 
contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
In this line, we finally start to define the contract. It's called MyNFT and extends (or uses as a template), hence is an ERC721, Ownable, and ReentrancyGuard, all of which we imported earlier. 

Now our contract contains the structures of all of those other contracts. 

Contract Properties
using Counters for Counters.Counter;
This line is saying, "When I say Counters.Counter from now on, I mean Counters." Confusing? I know.

Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
_tokenIds is where we'll store our token ids for our Non-Fungible Token. As this number can only ever increase in our contract, we know that whatever the current count is, we have minted that many NFTs.



mapping(uint256 => IContent.Item) Content;
We'll store the data using the token id as a "mapping." Think of mapping a set of labelled drawers. Regardless of the contents, you can use the label to locate the correct drawer. 

This function says, take a large number and map it to an item. We'll be using token ids to locate the NFT data in the Contents map.



uint256 price = 5000000000000000;
This gigantic number is actually a very small number. The price of the NFT in Wei. About 0.005 ETH.

Why such a huge number? Our values have to be integers, so we cannot use decimals. The workaround is to use huge numbers. uint256 allows for VERY large numbers.



address public renderingContractAddress;
When this NFT's data is requested, we'll send all of the data to this contract address for rendering.



event NewItem(address sender, uint256 tokenId, string name);
Here we define an event. "New Item." When creating a new NFT, the contract will shout this information out to the world "Hey everyone! the sender just created a new NFT with this token id and name!"

Application developers can watch for this event and respond with UI changes or let the user know the minting process is complete.



Contract Constructor
constructor() ERC721("MYNFT", "MYCOLLECTION") {
Here, we pass in the name and collection name of our NFT to the 'constructor.' From now on, whenever we create a new NFT using this contact, it will use this information to show that they are related. These names can be whatever you want them to be. 


Contract Generator Function
function GenerateNFT(string calldata ItemName, uint256[6] calldata Magic) public payable virtual {
Above is the definition of the NFT generator function. 

It takes two inputs, ItemName and Magic.

ItemName is a string which means it is text.
Magic is a list of six big numbers. uint256 is a big positive integer. [ ] is a list and 6 is how many spaces are available in the list. This is unique to our NFT, it's some special data we use to assign attributes and render the NFT.
calldata is the type of memory we want to use for these inputs. It's pretty technical, but it's the cheapest memory available to store our input data.
public payable virtual means that you are allowed to pay the contract to execute this function. 


require(msg.value >= price, "Not enough ETH sent; check price!");
Time to pay up!

A user is generating a new NFT; they need to supply the right amount of currency. If they didn't, halt the transaction immediately. 



uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
Get the current token id. We'll increment this number at the end. Getting the current ID allows us to start our NFTs at 0 instead of 1.



if (newItemId >= 10000) {

  revert("This NFT is sold out.");
}
If the token id exceeds this number, cancel the transaction. 

Creating a limit is what provides the much-hyped digital scarcity.



IContent.Item memory Item;
Create a new item instance. `Item` is our data structure for our NFT. 

Item.name = ItemName;
Set the name of our NFT to the ItemName we passed in.



Item.magic = Magic;
Set the Magic property of our NFT to the Magic data we passed in by the user.



Item.seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(newItemId,msg.sender,block.difficulty,block.timestamp)));
This hairy-looking piece of code creates our randomization seed. The seed value will be used as part of a random number generator. 

It's a big number (`uint256`) that uses a hashing function called `keccak256` and takes a string of the token id, the sender's address, the block difficulty, and the time of the transaction as input to generate a pseudo-random hash. 

abi.encodePacked combines all the pieces of information into one big string.

  

_safeMint(msg.sender, newItemId);
Mint the token to the sender's address using the token id. This function is from the ER721 contract we imported from OpenZepplin. It transfers the token id to the user. It creates and gives the NFT to the user.

Safe implies that it checks that the transfer will succeed.



Content[newItemId] = Item;
Store our item in the content "map" using the token id. Later, when calling tokenURI, we'll get our data from `Content` and use it to draw the NFT. 



emit NewItem(msg.sender, newItemId, ItemName);
Send out our notification event.



_tokenIds.increment();
Increase the token counter for the next NFT. That concludes our generator function!


Set Rendering Contract
function setRenderingContractAddress(address _renderingContractAddress) public onlyOwner {

renderingContractAddress = _renderingContractAddress; 

}
This function accepts an `address` as an input. It then stores it in `renderingContractAddress.`

Notice how it says "onlyOwner," Only the contract owner can use this function. onlyOwner stops everyone but the owner from setting the render contract address.

Set Price Function
function setPrice(uint256 _price) public onlyOwner 

   price = _price;

}
Pretty simple, the owner of the contract can set the price to mint the NFT. 



Total Content Function
function totalContent() public view virtual returns (uint256) 

   return _tokenIds.current();

}
This function returns the current count for the NFTs. This number will represent the total number of NFTs minted using this contract.



Token URI Function
tokenURI is the most important function in the entire contract because it allows you to 'see' your NFT. URI stands for Universal Resource Identifier. The token universal resource identifier.



function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory {
Anyone can call this function with a token id and see the NFT.

public view virtual override returns (string memory)

What a mouthful! Let's break it down.

public - means anyone can call this function. 
view - means that this function can only read from the contract but cannot write any new data. We can't charge users to look at their NFT, and writing to the blockchain requires a transaction fee. 
virtual override - This means we are changing the functionality of the template contracts we inherited. Each NFT project is different, so it's standard practice to change this function.
returns (string memory) - This function must return text.
To summarize, tokenURI is a function everyone can use to see the NFT data. It replaces the functionality in our library ERC721 contract with our own functionality and it returns a string (usually some data your browser can understand).



require( _exists(_tokenId), "ERC721Metadata: URI query for nonexistent token" );
Check if the token id passed in has an associated NFT. If one doesn't exist, we can return an error message.



if (renderingContractAddress == address(0)) {

   return "";

}
If there is no rendering contract, return nothing. The rendering contract will have a value of address(0) on deployment. The contract owner would need to call the setRenderContract function described earlier. 



IItemRenderer renderer = IItemRenderer(renderingContractAddress);
IItemRenderer is an interface to the item renderer contract. You obtain a reference by passing in an address. In this case, the renderContractAddress. 



return renderer.tokenURI(_tokenId, Content[_tokenId]);
Now that we have a copy of the renderer, we pass the token id and the NFT content we stored earlier. 

This renderer function will return a string with the name, description, image and metadata associated with the NFT. 



Withdraw
When minting an NFT, the minter pays the smart contract and gas fees. The gas fees go to miners, but the cryptocurrency goes to the contract and not the owner.

The owner of the contract can make a withdrawal at any time. Cryptocurrency is transferred from the contract to the owner's wallet when withdraw is called, precisely like cashing out a cash register. Miners take a part of the funds transferred to pay for the transaction. 



function withdraw() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
The withdrawal function is public, and anyone can access it, but only the owner can run it. The nonReentrant guard is a bit redundant, but this would prevent a reentrancy attack on this function.



(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
From a developer to the layperson, this is easily the most cryptic line in the entire contract.

It calls an anonymous function on the message sender (in this case, the owner) using the contract balance (all the Cryptocurrency collected in sales).

address(this).balance is the entire balance of the contract. So we'll transfer everything to the wallet.

If this call succeeds, success will be true. If not, it will be false;



require(success, "Withdrawal failed");
Require that the transfer be successful or send a message saying the withdrawal has failed.



The End
That's it! There is, of course, more to it. The ERC721 spec is quite long with a lot of functions. Programmers can cut down on the amount of work by starting from a library contract. This contract represents only the changes we've made to support our project.
